/**
 * @class LRU
 * @description LRU stands for "Least Recently Used" and is a caching algorithm used to manage memory. The LRU cache stores a limited number of items and discards the least recently used item when the cache is full and a new item is added. The LRU class is a TypeScript implementation of this algorithm, which can be used to manage a cache of key-value pairs.

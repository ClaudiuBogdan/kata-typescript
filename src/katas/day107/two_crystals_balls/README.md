# Two Crystal Balls

This algorithm aims to find the minimum number of attempts (drops) required to identify the floor from which a ball will break when dropped. The idea is that you have a building with `n` floors, and you need to find the lowest floor that will cause a ball to break when dropped from it. You have only a ball to perform this experiment, and you want to minimize the number of times you need to drop the ball to find that floor.

The algorithm employs dynamic programming to solve this problem, utilizing an array `dp` where `dp[i]` will store the minimum number of attempts needed to find the breaking floor if there are `i` floors.

Here's how the algorithm works:

### Initialization

```typescript
const dp = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, (_, i) => i);
```

1. An array `dp` of length `n+1` is initialized, where each index `i` is filled with the value `i`. This basically assumes the worst-case scenario initially, meaning that if you have `i` floors, you would need `i` attempts to find the breaking floor by checking each floor one-by-one.

### Nested Loop

```typescript
for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    for (let j = 1; j <= i; j++)
        dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], Math.max(1 + dp[i - j], j));
```

1. The outer loop (`i`) goes from 1 to `n`, representing each floor starting from the 1st floor to the nth floor.

2. The inner loop (`j`) iterates from 1 to `i`, simulating each possible drop scenario for that floor `i`.

3. `dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], Math.max(1 + dp[i - j], j));` is the core part. For every `j` from 1 to `i`, it updates `dp[i]` to store the minimum attempts needed.
    - `1 + dp[i - j]` simulates what happens if the ball breaks. If it breaks, you're left with `i-j` floors to check.
    - `j` simulates what happens if the ball does not break. If it doesn't break, you've effectively 'used up' `j` attempts.
    - `Math.max(1 + dp[i - j], j)` takes the worst case between the ball breaking and not breaking. You add `1` because you made an attempt by dropping the ball.
    - Finally, `Math.min(dp[i], ...)` stores the minimum attempts needed, comparing the current known minimum with the new calculated one.

### Return the Result

```typescript
return dp[n];
```

This returns the minimum number of drops required to find the breaking floor when there are `n` floors.

It's worth noting that the algorithm provided doesn't actually use the array of booleans (`breaks` parameter in the comments), which you'd typically use to represent the breaking behavior of the ball on each floor. Instead, it seems to be solving a more generalized form of the problem, assuming you don't know in advance where the ball will break.

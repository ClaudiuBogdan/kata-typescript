## Brief Summary

Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge weights, producing a shortest-path tree. This algorithm is used to find the minimum distance from the starting vertex to all other vertices in the given graph.

## Examples

- Finding the shortest path in a road network.
- Routing data in computer networks.
- Pathfinding algorithms in video games.

## Detailed Explanation

Dijkstra's algorithm works by iteratively selecting the unvisited vertex with the smallest tentative distance from the starting point. It then examines the vertex's neighbors and calculates their tentative distances, updating those if a shorter path is found. The algorithm continues this process until all vertices are visited or the shortest path to a specific target vertex is found.

## Code Example with Comments

Below is a simple example of Dijkstra's algorithm using TypeScript:

```typescript
function dijkstra(graph: number[][], start: number): number[] {
  const distances = Array(graph.length).fill(Infinity);
  distances[start] = 0;
  const visited = Array(graph.length).fill(false);

  for (let i = 0; i < graph.length; i++) {
    // Find the next vertex to be processed
    const vertex = distances.reduce(
      (minIdx, distance, idx) => (!visited[idx] && distance < distances[minIdx] ? idx : minIdx),
      -1
    );

    // Mark the vertex as visited
    visited[vertex] = true;

    // Update distances to neighbors
    graph[vertex].forEach((weight, neighbor) => {
      if (weight && !visited[neighbor]) {
        const newDistance = distances[vertex] + weight;
        if (newDistance < distances[neighbor]) {
          distances[neighbor] = newDistance;
        }
      }
    });
  }

  return distances;
}
```

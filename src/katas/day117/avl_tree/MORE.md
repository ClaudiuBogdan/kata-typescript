Absolutely! Let's break down how the AVL tree algorithm works to maintain its balanced structure.

**Core Concepts**

1. **Binary Search Tree (BST):** An AVL tree is a special type of binary search tree. In a BST, for any node:
   * Keys in the left subtree are smaller than the node's key.
   * Keys in the right subtree are larger than the node's key.

   This makes searching for elements efficient.

2. **Balance Factor:** The key to an AVL tree's self-balancing property is the *balance factor* of each node.
   * **Balance Factor = Height of Left Subtree - Height of Right Subtree**
   * In an AVL tree, every node's balance factor must be -1, 0, or 1.

3. **Rotations:** If a node's balance factor becomes too large (greater than 1 or less than -1), the AVL tree performs rotations to re-establish balance. There are four main rotation cases:
    * **Left Rotation:** Used when the balance factor is heavy on the right side.
    * **Right Rotation:** Used when the balance factor is heavy on the left side.
    * **Left-Right Rotation:** A double rotation used when a node's left child is right-heavy.
    * **Right-Left Rotation:** A double rotation used when a node's right child is left-heavy.

**Insertion**

1. **Insert like a BST:** A new element is initially inserted just like in a regular Binary Search Tree.
2. **Update Heights:** After insertion, retrace the path back to the root, updating the height of each node along the way.
3. **Check Balance Factors:**  At each node, check its balance factor. If it remains within -1, 0, or 1, the tree is still balanced.
4. **Rotate if Needed:** If a node's balance factor falls outside the allowed range, perform the appropriate rotation(s) to rebalance the tree.

**Deletion**

1. **Delete like a BST:** Remove the node as you would in a standard Binary Search Tree.
2. **Update Heights:** Retrace the path to the root, updating heights of affected nodes.
3. **Rebalance:** Check the balance factors of nodes along the path and perform rotations as needed to maintain the AVL property.

**Visual Resources**

Understanding AVL trees conceptually is important, but it truly clicks when you see the rotations in action. Here are some excellent visual resources:

* **Animation of AVL Trees:**  [https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/AVLtree.html](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/AVLtree.html)
* **YouTube Videos:** Search for "AVL Tree Visualization" on YouTube. Many great videos demonstrate insertions, deletions, and rotations.

**Practice**

1. **Manual Practice:** Try inserting and deleting elements on a whiteboard or a piece of paper to understand the rotations.
2. **Implementations:**  If you feel comfortable, try implementing the AVL Tree yourself using the code we refined earlier.

/**
 * @function Dijkstra
 * @description Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge weights, producing a shortest-path tree. This algorithm is used to find the minimum distance from the starting vertex to all other vertices in the given graph.

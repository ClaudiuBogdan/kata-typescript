/**
 * Finds the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted, directed graph using the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm.
 *
 * @param {number[][]} graph - A 2D array representing the adjacency matrix of the graph. graph[i][j] represents the weight of the edge from vertex i to vertex j. Infinity indicates no edge.
 * @returns {number[][]} A 2D array representing the shortest path lengths between all pairs of vertices.
 *
 * @example
 * floydWarshall([[0, 5, Infinity, 10], [Infinity, 0, 3, Infinity], [Infinity, Infinity, 0, 1], [Infinity, Infinity, Infinity, 0]]);
 * returns [[0, 5, 8, 9], [Infinity, 0, 3, 4], [Infinity, Infinity, 0, 1], [Infinity, Infinity, Infinity, 0]]

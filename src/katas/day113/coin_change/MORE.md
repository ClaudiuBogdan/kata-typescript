This algorithm is an implementation of the dynamic programming approach to solve the Coin Change problem. The goal is to find the minimum number of coins that you need to make up a certain amount of money, given an array of coin denominations. It's a classic problem that demonstrates the utility of dynamic programming for optimizing decisions based on previous computations.

Let's break down how this algorithm works, step by step:

### 1. Initialization

```typescript
const dp = new Array(amount + 1).fill(Infinity);
dp[0] = 0;
```

- A dynamic programming array `dp` is created with a length of `amount + 1`. This array is filled with `Infinity` to represent the initial state where the minimum number of coins needed to make up any amount is unknown and considered infinite.
- `dp[0] = 0` sets the base case. No coins are needed to make up an amount of 0.

### 2. Dynamic Programming Loop

```typescript
for (let i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
    for (let coin of coins) {
        const comp = i - coin;
        if (comp >= 0 && dp[comp] < Infinity) {
            dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[comp] + 1);
        }
    }
}
```

- The algorithm iterates through each amount from `1` to `amount`, inclusively. For each amount `i`, it checks every coin denomination.
- `const comp = i - coin;` calculates the complement, which is the remaining amount after using one coin of the current denomination. If this coin is part of the optimal solution for amount `i`, the remaining amount (`comp`) should already have an optimal solution calculated in previous steps.
- The condition `if (comp >= 0 && dp[comp] < Infinity)` checks if the complement is a valid amount (non-negative) and if there's an existing solution for the complement (i.e., it's possible to make up the `comp` amount with the given coins).
- `dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[comp] + 1);` updates the current amount's minimum coins needed by comparing the existing value with the new computed value (`dp[comp] + 1`). The `+1` represents adding the current coin to the complement's solution to form the amount `i`.

### 3. Return the Result

```typescript
return dp[amount] < Infinity ? dp[amount] : -1;
```

- Finally, the algorithm checks if `dp[amount]` is less than `Infinity`. If it is, it means there's a solution, and the minimum number of coins needed is returned. If not, it means it's impossible to make up the amount with the given coin denominations, and `-1` is returned.

### Summary

The essence of this algorithm is to build up solutions to smaller subproblems (making up smaller amounts) and use those solutions to solve larger problems (making up the target amount). It efficiently finds the minimum number of coins needed by reusing previously computed solutions, avoiding the need for brute force calculations and thereby significantly reducing the computational complexity.

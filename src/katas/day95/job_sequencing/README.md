# Job Sequencing

The Job Sequencing Problem is an optimization problem where you are given a set of jobs, each with a deadline and profit associated with it. The goal is to schedule the jobs in such a way that you maximize the total profit, under the constraint that each job takes a single unit of time and must be completed before its deadline.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of a common greedy algorithm used to solve this problem:

1. Sort all jobs in decreasing order of profit.
2. Initialize the result sequence with the first job in the sorted array.
3. Do the following for the remaining jobs in the sorted array:
   - If the current job can fit in the current result sequence without missing the deadline, add it to the result. To check if a job can fit, compare its deadline with all jobs already added to the result sequence.

This algorithm works because it always considers the most profitable jobs first, and only includes a job if it can be completed before its deadline.

Here's a simple implementation in Python:

```python
def JobScheduling(jobs, t):
    # Sort jobs according to decreasing order of profit
    jobs.sort(key = lambda x: x[2], reverse = True)
    
    # To keep track of free time slots
    result = [False] * t
    
    # To store result (Sequence of jobs)
    job = ['-1'] * t
    
    # Iterate through all given jobs
    for i in range(len(jobs)):
        # Find a free slot for this job (Note that we start from the last possible slot)
        for j in range(min(t - 1, jobs[i][1] - 1), -1, -1):
            # Free slot found
            if result[j] is False:
                result[j] = True
                job[j] = jobs[i][0]
                break
                
    # Print the sequence
    print(job)

# Driver code
jobs = [['a', 2, 100],  # Job Array
        ['b', 1, 19],
        ['c', 2, 27],
        ['d', 1, 25],
        ['e', 3, 15]]
        
# Function Call
JobScheduling(jobs, 3)
```

In this code, `jobs` is an array of jobs where each job is represented as an array with three elements - the job name, the deadline for the job, and the profit from the job. The function `JobScheduling` schedules the jobs to maximize profit.

## Uses

The Job Sequencing Problem has applications in a variety of fields, particularly those involving scheduling and resource allocation. Here are a few examples:

1. **Operating Systems**: In computer operating systems, job scheduling is a key component. The OS must decide which processes to run, when to run them, and in what order, given a set of processes to execute, their CPU burst times, and their arrival times.

2. **Production Scheduling**: In manufacturing, jobs often have to be scheduled on machines or production lines. Each job might have a deadline by which it needs to be completed and a profit or cost associated with its early or late completion.

3. **Project Management**: In project management, tasks (jobs) often have deadlines and benefits associated with their completion. The job sequencing problem can help determine the order in which to undertake tasks to maximize the overall benefit.

4. **Cloud Computing**: In cloud computing, tasks need to be scheduled and executed on a set of available resources. Each task might have a deadline and a profit associated with its completion.

5. **Networking**: In computer networks, packets could be considered as jobs that need to be scheduled for transmission to ensure Quality of Service (QoS).

Remember, the Job Sequencing Problem assumes that each job takes the same amount of time. In real-world applications, this might not always be the case, and more complex algorithms might be needed.

## Time and space complexity

The time complexity of the job sequencing algorithm is mainly determined by the sorting operation and the two nested loops.

1. Sorting the jobs based on profit in decreasing order takes O(n log n) time, where n is the number of jobs.

2. The outer loop runs n times, and the inner loop can run up to n times in the worst case (when all jobs have the same deadline). Therefore, the time complexity of these nested loops is O(n^2).

So, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(n log n) + O(n^2). However, in Big O notation, we usually only consider the highest order term, so we can say that the time complexity of the job sequencing algorithm is O(n^2) in the worst case.

The space complexity of the job sequencing algorithm is determined by the additional space we're using apart from the input.

1. The `result` array that stores the scheduled jobs. In the worst case, this array can have the same number of elements as the input array, so its space complexity is O(n).

2. The `timeSlots` array that keeps track of the filled time slots. This array also has a length equal to the number of jobs, so its space complexity is also O(n).

Therefore, the overall space complexity of the job sequencing algorithm is O(n) + O(n) = O(2n). However, in Big O notation, we ignore constants, so we can say that the space complexity of the job sequencing algorithm is O(n).

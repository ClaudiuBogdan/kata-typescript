 * @function Prims - Prim's algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree
 * @description Prim's algorithm is a minimum spanning tree algorithm that takes a graph as input and finds the subset of the edges of that graph which form a tree that includes every vertex, and has the minimum sum of weights among all the trees that can be formed from the graph

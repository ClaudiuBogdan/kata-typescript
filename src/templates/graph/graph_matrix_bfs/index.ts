 * @function bfs - Breadth First search on a Matrix Graph
 * @description An adjacency matrix is a way of representing a graph as a matrix of booleans (0's and 1's). A finite graph can be represented in the form of a square matrix on a computer, where the boolean value of the matrix indicates if there is a direct path between two vertices.

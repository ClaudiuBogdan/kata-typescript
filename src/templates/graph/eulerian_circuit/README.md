# Eulerian Circuit

## Problem Description

An Eulerian circuit (or Eulerian cycle) is a closed walk in a graph that visits every edge exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. The problem of finding an Eulerian circuit can be stated as follows:

**Given a graph \( G(V, E) \) with vertices \( V \) and edges \( E \), determine whether an Eulerian circuit exists. If it exists, find such a circuit.**

A graph has an Eulerian circuit if and only if it is connected (except for isolated vertices) and all vertices have an even degree.

### Formal Definition

Let \( G = (V, E) \) be an undirected graph, where \( V \) is the set of vertices and \( E \) is the set of edges. An Eulerian circuit is a sequence \( (v_0, v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k) \) where \( v_0 = v_k \) and:

-   \( (v*i, v*{i+1}) \) is an edge in \( E \) for \( 0 \leq i < k \)
-   Every edge in \( E \) appears exactly once in the sequence

## Algorithms to Solve the Problem

There are various algorithms to find an Eulerian circuit in a graph, if it exists. The most commonly used algorithms are:

1. **Hierholzer's Algorithm**: This algorithm starts at any vertex in the graph, and follows edges until it returns to the starting vertex, thereby creating a circuit. It then iteratively extends this circuit until all edges are included.
2. **Fleuryâ€™s Algorithm**: This is a more intuitive but less efficient algorithm. It starts at a vertex and moves along edges, but takes care not to "bridge" the graph unless necessary (i.e., it avoids removing edges that would disconnect the remaining graph).

For most practical purposes, Hierholzer's Algorithm is preferred due to its linear time complexity \( O(|E|) \).

# Hamiltonian cycle

### Problem Description

The Hamiltonian Cycle Problem is a graph theory problem that asks whether a given graph \( G(V, E) \) contains a Hamiltonian cycleâ€”a simple cycle that visits every vertex exactly once and returns to the original vertex. In formal terms, a Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that traverses all the vertices \( V \) exactly once, except for the starting and ending vertex, which is the same and is visited twice.

#### Formally

Given a graph \( G(V, E) \) with \( V \) vertices and \( E \) edges, does there exist a sequence of vertices \( v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n, v_1 \) such that:

1. \( v_i \) is a vertex in \( V \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq n \)
2. \( (v*i, v*{i+1}) \) is an edge in \( E \) for \( 1 \leq i < n \)
3. \( v*1 = v*{n+1} \)
4. Each vertex \( v \in V \) appears exactly once in \( v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n \)

### Algorithms to Solve Hamiltonian Cycle Problem

The Hamiltonian cycle problem is NP-complete, which means that there is no known polynomial-time algorithm to solve all instances of this problem unless \( P = NP \). Here are some approaches:

#### Brute-force

The brute-force approach involves generating all possible sequences of vertices and checking whether any of them form a Hamiltonian cycle. The time complexity is \( O(n!) \), which is impractical for large graphs.

```typescript
// TypeScript pseudo-code for brute-force Hamiltonian cycle
function hasHamiltonianCycle(graph: boolean[][], n: number): boolean {
    // Generate permutations and check if any is a Hamiltonian Cycle
    // ...
    return false;
}
```

#### Backtracking

The backtracking approach starts from a vertex and keeps adding a new vertex to the path while making sure that it leads to a Hamiltonian cycle. If it doesn't, it backtracks.

```typescript
// TypeScript pseudo-code for backtracking
function isHamiltonian(
    graph: boolean[][],
    path: number[],
    pos: number,
    n: number,
): boolean {
    // Check if current vertex can be added to Hamiltonian Cycle
    // ...

    // If the Hamiltonian cycle is found, return true
    // ...

    return false;
}
```

The backtracking algorithm has a time complexity of \( O(n!) \) in the worst case but is often faster in practice.

#### Dynamic Programming (Held-Karp)

Although it doesn't solve the problem in polynomial time, the Held-Karp algorithm is faster than the brute-force and backtracking approaches for some special cases. It has a time complexity of \( O(n^2 2^n) \).

```typescript
// TypeScript pseudo-code for Held-Karp algorithm
function heldKarp(graph: number[][], n: number): number {
    // DP solution to find the shortest Hamiltonian Cycle
    // ...
    return -1;
}
```

#### Heuristics

Approximation and heuristic algorithms like Nearest Neighbor, Minimum Spanning Tree, etc., can be used to find a "good enough" solution when an exact solution is not feasible.

Let's delve deeper into the comparison between the Backtracking and Dynamic Programming (Held-Karp) approaches for solving the Hamiltonian Cycle Problem.

### Backtracking Approach

#### How it Works

The backtracking algorithm builds a cycle by starting from a vertex and adding a new vertex to the path one at a time. At each step, it verifies whether the new vertex can be added to the cycle without breaking the Hamiltonian cycle rules. If it reaches a point where it cannot extend the cycle, it backtracks and tries another path.

#### Time Complexity

The time complexity in the worst-case scenario is \(O(n!)\) because, in the worst case, you might need to traverse all permutations of vertices. However, the algorithm will often run faster in practice because it prunes many branches of the search tree when it detects that they cannot possibly lead to a Hamiltonian cycle.

#### Space Complexity

The space complexity is \(O(n)\) for storing the path and \(O(n^2)\) for storing the graph. Recursion would also add an additional \(O(n)\) overhead.

#### Pros and Cons

-   **Pros**: Simple to understand and implement. Works well for small instances and can prune search space efficiently.
-   **Cons**: Factorial time complexity makes it impractical for large instances.

### Dynamic Programming (Held-Karp Algorithm)

#### How it Works

The Held-Karp algorithm is more commonly used for solving the Hamiltonian Path problem's "weighted" cousin, the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). However, it can be adapted for the Hamiltonian cycle problem. It uses dynamic programming to store sub-problems of partial paths and uses these stored solutions to construct the Hamiltonian cycle.

#### Time Complexity

The time complexity is \(O(n^2 2^n)\), which is exponential but often better than \(O(n!)\). This is because it solves each sub-problem only once and uses the solution to solve larger problems.

#### Space Complexity

The space complexity is \(O(n 2^n)\) to store the solutions to the sub-problems.

#### Pros and Cons

-   **Pros**: Better time complexity than backtracking for some instances. Particularly useful when the graph has a large number of vertices but the Hamiltonian cycle has particular characteristics that can be exploited.
-   **Cons**: More complex to implement and understand. Still not polynomial time, so not practical for all large instances.

### Comparison

| Feature                    | Backtracking | Dynamic Programming |
| -------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| Time Complexity            | \(O(n!)\)    | \(O(n^2 2^n)\)      |
| Space Complexity           | \(O(n^2)\)   | \(O(n 2^n)\)        |
| Implementation Complexity  | Easier       | More Complex        |
| Efficiency for small \(n\) | Often good   | Usually overkill    |
| Pruning                    | Yes          | Not Applicable      |

The Held-Karp algorithm is generally more efficient for graphs with a large number of vertices but is overkill for small instances where backtracking works well. The backtracking approach is easier to implement and understand but becomes impractical for large graphs due to its factorial time complexity.

Absolutely, let's dive into the backtracking approach for solving the Hamiltonian Cycle Problem.

### Backtracking Algorithm

The backtracking algorithm aims to build a Hamiltonian cycle incrementally, abandoning a path as soon as it violates the constraints (i.e., revisiting a previously visited vertex or failing to close the cycle properly). The algorithm starts from an arbitrary vertex (usually the first vertex) and extends the cycle by exploring each vertex that is connected to the current vertex.

#### Pseudocode

Here is a simplified pseudocode for the backtracking algorithm to find a Hamiltonian Cycle:

```
1. Start with an empty path and add an arbitrary vertex to it.
2. Explore each neighboring vertex of the last vertex in the path:
  a. If adding the vertex to the path yields a valid path:
      i. Add the vertex to the path.
      ii. If the path is a Hamiltonian cycle, return "Found".
      iii. Recursively continue the algorithm to extend the path.
      iv. If the path from the recursive call leads to a Hamiltonian cycle, return "Found".
  b. Remove the vertex from the path (backtrack) if it doesn't lead to a solution.
3. If all vertices are explored and none lead to a Hamiltonian cycle, return "Not Found".
```

#### TypeScript Implementation

Here's a TypeScript example to demonstrate the backtracking algorithm. I assume that the graph is represented as an adjacency matrix.

```typescript
type AdjMatrix = number[][];

function isSafe(
    v: number,
    pos: number,
    path: number[],
    graph: AdjMatrix,
): boolean {
    // Check if this vertex is an adjacent vertex of the previously added vertex.
    if (graph[path[pos - 1]][v] === 0) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the vertex has already been included.
    if (path.includes(v)) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}

function hamiltonianCycleUtil(
    graph: AdjMatrix,
    path: number[],
    pos: number,
): boolean {
    // Base case: If all vertices are included in the cycle
    if (pos === graph.length) {
        // And if there is an edge from the last vertex to the first vertex
        if (graph[path[pos - 1]][path[0]] === 1) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }

    // Try different vertices as the next candidate in the Hamiltonian Cycle.
    for (let v = 1; v < graph.length; v++) {
        // Check if this vertex can be added to the Hamiltonian Cycle
        if (isSafe(v, pos, path, graph)) {
            path[pos] = v;

            // Recur to construct the rest of the path
            if (hamiltonianCycleUtil(graph, path, pos + 1)) {
                return true;
            }

            // Remove the vertex if it doesn't lead to a solution
            path[pos] = -1;
        }
    }

    // No solution from this vertex, backtrack.
    return false;
}

function findHamiltonianCycle(graph: AdjMatrix): number[] | null {
    const path: number[] = new Array(graph.length).fill(-1);
    path[0] = 0; // Start from vertex 0

    if (hamiltonianCycleUtil(graph, path, 1)) {
        return path;
    } else {
        return null;
    }
}

// Test
const graph: AdjMatrix = [
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
];
const result = findHamiltonianCycle(graph);
console.log("Hamiltonian Cycle:", result);
```

In this example, the function `findHamiltonianCycle` attempts to find a Hamiltonian cycle in the graph represented by the adjacency matrix `graph`. It initializes a `path` array that will eventually store the Hamiltonian cycle if one exists. The function `hamiltonianCycleUtil` is a utility function that performs the backtracking. The function `isSafe` checks whether it's safe to add a vertex to the current `path`.

Using an array of booleans to keep track of visited vertices can actually be more efficient than using a `Set` for this specific case. The reason is that array access by index is usually faster than hash table lookups (which is what a `Set` uses under the hood). Moreover, JavaScript arrays are contiguous blocks of memory, which is cache-friendlier.

Here's how you can modify the TypeScript code to use an array of booleans for `visited`:

```typescript
type AdjMatrix = number[][];

function isSafe(
    v: number,
    visited: boolean[],
    graph: AdjMatrix,
    lastVertex: number,
): boolean {
    // Check if this vertex is an adjacent vertex of the last added vertex.
    if (graph[lastVertex][v] === 0) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the vertex has already been included.
    if (visited[v]) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}

function hamiltonianCycleUtil(
    graph: AdjMatrix,
    path: number[],
    pos: number,
    visited: boolean[],
): boolean {
    if (pos === graph.length) {
        return graph[path[pos - 1]][path[0]] === 1;
    }

    for (const v of graph[path[pos - 1]]) {
        if (isSafe(v, visited, graph, path[pos - 1])) {
            path[pos] = v;
            visited[v] = true;

            if (hamiltonianCycleUtil(graph, path, pos + 1, visited)) {
                return true;
            }

            visited[v] = false;
            path[pos] = -1;
        }
    }

    return false;
}

function findHamiltonianCycle(graph: AdjMatrix): number[] | null {
    const path: number[] = new Array(graph.length).fill(-1);
    const visited: boolean[] = new Array(graph.length).fill(false);
    path[0] = 0;
    visited[0] = true;

    if (hamiltonianCycleUtil(graph, path, 1, visited)) {
        return path;
    } else {
        return null;
    }
}

// Test graph as adjacency list for simplicity
const graph: AdjMatrix = [
    [1, 3],
    [0, 2, 3, 4],
    [1, 4],
    [0, 1, 4],
    [1, 2, 3],
];
const result = findHamiltonianCycle(graph);
console.log("Hamiltonian Cycle:", result);
```

In this modified code, `visited` is an array of booleans. We set `visited[v] = true` when vertex `v` is added to the path and set it back to `false` when we backtrack. The `isSafe` function has been updated to check the `visited` array instead of a `Set`.

Using an array of booleans for `visited` can offer a small but potentially significant performance gain due to faster lookups and updates.

/**
 * Finds the shortest paths from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted, directed graph using the Bellman-Ford Algorithm.

 * @param {number} source - The source vertex from which to find the shortest paths.
 * @returns {number[]} An array representing the shortest path lengths from the source vertex to all other vertices. Returns null if a negative weight cycle is detected.
